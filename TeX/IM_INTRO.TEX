\section{Introduction}
\label{image:intro}

The general field of automated image processing may be divided into
four main categories~(\cite{digim}):

\begin{description}
\item[Image digitization:] Converting continous (real) images into
  discrete (digitized) form.
\item[Image enhancement and restoration:] Improving degraded (blurred,
  noisy) images.
\item[Image encoding:] Techniques for representing an image, or the
  information contained in the image, with fewer bits than was needed
  for the ``raw'' image.
\item[Image segmentation, representation, and description:] Image
  segmentation is the process that subdivides an image into its
  constituents regions or objects.  Image representation and
  description are important processes in the implementation of
  autonomous image processing and analysis systems.
\end{description}

{\em Digital\/} image processing deals with the latter three of these
categories, in that it requires already digitized images as input.  In
this chapter, an introduction is given to the fields of {\em image
  enhancement and restoration\/}, and {\em image segmentation\/}, with
an inclination towards the problem at hand, namely recognition and
location of the pupil within a digital image of the eye.  For a
thorough problem definition, see Section~\ref{algo:problem}.

The structure of the chapter is as follows:
Section~\ref{image:domains} gives an introduction to image analysis in
the frequency plane; Section~\ref{image:noise} addresses the problem
of noise reduction; Section~\ref{image:enhance} discusses image
enhancement techniques; in Section~\ref{image:pattern}, the problem of
pattern recognition is presented, and in Section~\ref{image:edge},
some edge detection approaches are discussed.  In
Section~\ref{image:concl}, a conclusion is drawn as to which technique
to choose for the problem at hand.
