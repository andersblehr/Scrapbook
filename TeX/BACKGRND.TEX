\chapter{Background}
\label{back}

This chapter consists of three sections.  In
Section~\ref{back:problem}, the problem definition to which my thesis
work has been related is given.  According to this definition,
Section~\ref{back:eye} defines a number of terms relating to the eye,
and touches briefly upon its structure, whereas
Section~\ref{back:track} presents the most frequent approaches to the
problem of real-time eye tracking.
