\chapter{Background}
\label{back}

This chapter consists of two sections.  With the problem definition
given in Section~\ref{intro:problem} in mind, Section~\ref{back:eye}
defines a number of terms relating to the eye and touches briefly upon
its structure, whereas Section~\ref{back:track} presents the most
frequent approaches to the problem of real-time eye tracking, drawing
a conclusion as to why it was chosen to develop an entirely new
system, as mentioned in Section~\ref{intro:motivation}.
