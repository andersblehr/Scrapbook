\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{concl}

As pointed out in Section~\ref{intro:problem}, the original aim of my
thesis work was to develop a complete eye-tracking system, comprising
the non-algorithmic as well as the algorithmic aspects of the overall
problem definition.  However, given the limited time available, this
turned out not to be feasible.  In fact, during the last six months,
neither a frame-grabbing board nor a camera satisfying both the
technical and the low-cost requirements has been found, and
consequently it has become more or less clear that the DM 12,000 at
the group's disposal for developing the eye-tracking system may not
suffice.
