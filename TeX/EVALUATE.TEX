\chapter{Evaluation and Chosen Approach}
\label{eval}

In the first section of this chapter, Section~\ref{eval:eval}, the
different techniques presented in the previous chapter are evaluated
as to their individual applicability to the problem at hand.  In
Section~\ref{eval:approach}, on the basis of the foregoing
evaluation, a conclusion is drawn as to which approach to take in
developing an algorithm to solve the problem.  The proposed algorithm
itself is is presented in Chapter~\ref{algo}.
