This chapter is intendent to give an overall view of the background
and motivation for my thesis work.  In Section~\ref{intro:synch}, a
brief description of the project of which the work has been a part,
the {\em Synchronization and Cognition\/} (SC) project, is given.  The
motivation of my assignment, as related to the SC project, is
described in Section~\ref{intro:motivation}.  In
Section~\ref{intro:problem}, a thorough definition, hereafter referred
to as the {\em problem definition\/}, of what has been my task within
the SC project is given.  The working environment I have been
subjected to is described in Section~\ref{intro:env}, and in the last
section of the chapter, Section~\ref{intro:structure}, the overall
structure of the paper is presented.
