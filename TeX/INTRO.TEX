This chapter is intendent to give an overall view of the background
and motivation for my thesis work.  In Section~\ref{intro:synch}, a
brief description of the project of which the work has been a part,
the {\em Synchronization and Cognition\/} (SC) project, is given.  The
motivation for my assignment as related to the SC project is described
in Section~\ref{intro:motivation}.  In Section~\ref{intro:problem}, a
thorough definition, hereafter referred to as the {\em problem
  definition\/}, of what has been my task within the SC project is
given.  In the last section of the chapter, Section~\ref{intro:env},
the working environment I have been subjected to is described.
