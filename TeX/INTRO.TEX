\chapter{Introduction}
\label{intro}

This chapter is intendent to give an overall view of the background
and motivation for my thesis work.  In Section~\ref{intro:synch}, a
brief description of the project of which the work has been a part,
the {\em Synchronization and Cognition\/} (SC) project, is given.  The
motivation of my assignment, as related to the SC project, is
described in Section~\ref{intro:motivation}.  In
Section~\ref{intro:problem}, a thorough definition of what has been my
task within the SC project, hereafter referred to as the {\em problem
  definition\/}, is given.  In the last section of the chapter,
Section~\ref{intro:env}, the working environment I have been subjected
to is described.
