\chapter{Introduction}
\label{intro}

\section{Synchronization and Cognition}
\label{intro:synch}

{\em Synchronization and Cognition\/} ({\em SC\/}) is a cooperation
project initiated by R.\ Eckhorn and R.\ Bauer of the Biophysics Group
and F.\ R\"{o}sler of the \typeout{--> Roeslers gruppe?} Psychology
Group at the Philipps-Universit\"{a}t Marburg, Germany.

The basis of the current work is observations done by R.\ Eckhorn and
R.\ Bauer~(\cite{cat}), as well as by the group of W.\ Singer
(e.g.,~\cite{singer2} and~\cite{singer1}), that when stimulated,
retinally \typeout{--> retinotop = retinal??} distributed and
rhythmically correlated neural assemblies organize in peripheral
visual areas in the brain of drugged cats.  The spacial distribution
of these assemblies, but not their frequencies, depend on the supplied
visual stimulus.

The goal of the {\em SC\/} project is, through the use of
microelectrodes (monkeys) and EEG recordings (humans), to show that
coherent neurological activations ({\em synchronizations\/}) in the
visual cortex, relating to coherent visual stimuli, is a requirement
for the coherent perception of these stimuli.  In addition, the
time-space {\em synchronization dynamics\/} in peripheral and central,
as well as in intermediate cortex areas, are to be investigated as to
how they relate to the cognitive tasks being performed.

For a further description of the {\em SC\/} project,
see~\cite{antrag}.  Some of the publications by R.\ Eckhorn {\em et
  al.\/} concerning the discovery and implications of synchronizations
in the visual cortex of cats and monkeys
are~\cite{eckhorn1},~\cite{eckhorn2},~\cite{cat} and~\cite{eckhorn3}.

\section{Thesis Motivation}
\label{intro:motivation}

Since the direction of gaze and the orientation of the visual stimuli
have to correspond as exactly as possible, in order to be certain that
exactly those neural assemblies are stimulated whose activity is being
registered, it is of vital importance for the validity of the
experimental results that the exact eye position of the subject be
known at a given time.  Otherwise the danger exists of registering
neurological responses whose variations are not the result of the
assigned cognitive task, but of the subject's incorrect gaze
direction.

To gain absolute certainty about where the subject at a given time
focuses, it is necessary to have a system which continuously tracks
the movements of the subject's eyes, and which every $\sim 20 ms$
makes available a coordinate pair corresponding as closesly as
possible to the actual gaze direction.  When the subject is {\em
  drifting\/}, that is, it does not focus where it should, a warning
signal has to be given.

There exist several commercially available eye tracking systems, some
of which are described in Section~\ref{back:track}.  All of these
systems are more expensive than what the financial means \typeout{-->
  Hva er "bevilgning" paa engelsk?} of the project group allow, and in
addition many of them require physical implantations in the eye, which
is consider undesirable.  For these reasons it was decided to develop
an entirely new eye tracking system, based on real-time image
processing of video input.  And this is, in short, what has been the
subject of my thesis; to develop, and, as far as possible, test a
suitable {\em software platform\/} for a real-time eye position
measuring system complying to the requirements of precision and speed
mentioned above.
