\section{Sources}
\label{implem:sources}

Two source files are listed in this section.  The first is the
Turbo-Pascal unit {\tt search.pas}, implementing the {\octopus}
eye-tracking algorithm, and the second is {\tt eyepos.pas}, which is
an example of how to use {\tt search.pas}.  Note that the variable
names used in the implementations do not correspond particularly well
with the notation used throughout his paper.

\subsection{\tt search.pas}
\label{implem:sources:search}

This Turbo-Pascal unit implements the {\octopus} eye-tracking
algorithm.  The two main procedures are {\tt findPupilPoint} and {\tt
  findPosition}, implementing Steps 1 and 2, respectively, of the
basic algorithm formulation.  See in-line comments for additional
information.

\subsection{\tt eyepos.pas}
\label{implem:sources:eyepos}

This file contains an example of how to use {\tt search.pas} to locate
the pupil in an image.  It also illustrates the principle used to
obtain the time measures presented in Section~\ref{algo:eval:test}.
Lastly, the currently available command line options are shown.
