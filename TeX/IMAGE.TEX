\chapter{Digital Image Processing}
\label{image}

In this chapter, an introduction to the vast field of digital image
processing is given, with an inclination towards the problem at hand,
namely recognition and location of the pupil within a digital image of
the eye.  A thorough problem definition is given in
Section~\ref{image:intro}, along with a presentation of the general
fields of digital image processing and an introduction to spatial and
frequency plane analysis.  In Section~\ref{image:noise}, the problem
of noise reduction is addressed; Section~\ref{image:enhance} discusses
image enhancement techniques; in Section~\ref{image:pattern}, the
problem of pattern recognition is presented, and in
Section~\ref{image:edge}, some edge detection approaches are
discussed.  In Section~\ref{image:concl}, a conclusion is drawn as to
which technique to choose for the problem at hand.
