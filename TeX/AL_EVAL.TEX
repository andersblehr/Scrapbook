\section{Evaluation}

\subsection{Overall Number of Operations}
\label{algo:eval:O}

In Section~\ref{algo:seek:O}, it was shown that the swimming octopus
search algorithm, described in Section~\ref{algo:seek} and
implementing Step 1 in the basic algorithm formulation given in
Section~\ref{eval:approach:algo}, performs in $O(N)$ time when applied
to an $N\times N$ image.  In Section~\ref{algo:pos:O} it was shown
that the position determining algorithm described in
Section~\ref{algo:pos}, implementing Step 2 of the basic algorithm
formulation, performs in $O(N)$ time.  Thus it can be concluded that
the {\octopus} eye-tracking algorithm, being composed of the given
implementations of Steps 1 and 2 of the basic algorithm formulations,
performs in $O(N)$ time.
