\begin{abstract}
  
  This paper constitutes my final report in course {\em 45073
  Computer Science, Projects\/} at The Norwegian Institute of
  Technology, Division of Computer Science \& Telematics. The aim of
  my work has been to develop and implement a prototype of a natural
  language based expert system shell. In connection with this, I have
  sought to address some of the general problems related to the field
  of natural language processing, as well as to define a suitable
  platform on which to base my implementation.
